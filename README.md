This project shows off my ability to handle objects within Javascript.

Within the WebApp, you can save information about books you want to keep track of and whether you have read them already.

## Programming Highlights:
- The program can create, read, update and delete the books added by the user. 
- Using local storage book info is saved in the userâ€™s browser, so the website can keep track of added books even when users leave the webpage and return later.
